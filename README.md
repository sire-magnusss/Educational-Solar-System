# Educational 3D Solar System

### Educational 3D Solar System is an interactive, visually immersive simulation built with Three.js. This project was born out of my exploration of Three.js and a desire to create an educational tool for children to spark their curiosity about our Solar System.

## Features
Interactive 3D Exploration:
Navigate a realistic solar system complete with a starry skybox, large, spaced-out planets, and dynamic space debris such as shooting stars and meteorites.

## Educational Planetary Information:
Hover over any planet to display its name, and click on it to open an info panel with detailed, structured educational content. Each planet's information is divided into consistent sections such as:

## Overview: A general introduction.
Surface & Atmosphere: Key details about temperature, surface features, and atmospheric conditions.
Orbit & Rotation: Information about orbital periods, unique spin properties, and resonance phenomena.
Dimensions & Other Facts: Important metrics and interesting scientific insights.
Sleek UI & Aesthetic Details:
The info panel features a semi-transparent, glass-effect design with a custom-styled scrollbar to enhance the tech-space vibe.

## Responsive & Smooth Animations:
Frame-rateâ€“independent animations ensure smooth motion for planetary orbits, spins, and space debris effects.

## Getting Started
## Prerequisites
A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
A local web server for serving ES modules (e.g., VS Code Live Server or Python's http.server)
Installation
I'll assume you know how to clone a repo, bc why would u even be here lol XD

## Tip
Use VS Code Live Server by right-clicking index.html and selecting "Open with Live Server.

Open Your Browser: Navigate to http://localhost:8000 to view the project.

# OR

Just use IntelliJ IDE then run index.html bc intelliJ has it own local server for running such.

## Technologies Used
Three.js: For 3D rendering and scene management.
JavaScript (ES Modules): For modular, interactive code.
HTML5 & CSS3: For structure and aesthetic styling.
Git & GitHub: For version control and hosting.
Project Background
While learning Three.js, I found myself fascinated by space and wanted to build an educational project that made learning about our Solar System both fun and immersive. This project is designed to be an interactive tool for students and curious minds alike, blending art, science, and technology in one engaging simulation.
